## My Projects

<br>

* [Sentimenta.org](http://sentimenta.org/) 

My project focused on determining stock sentiments using Natural Language Processing. Sentimenta is a website focused on helping users decide which companies to invest in.

I used NLP and extracted news articles from various news outlets, extracted company names and the headlines in which they appeared, and finally calculated companiesâ€™ overall sentiments (positive/negative) based on various keywords found in the headlines.

I designed layout of the website for ease of viewing. I am regularly improving the user interface and accuracy of data.

Software/Tools used: Python, MySQL, Linux, Apache, AWS EC2 and S3, Route 53, Jupyter Notebook, and NLTK.
<br>
* [Tempe Accidents Dashboard](https://arch-1000.shinyapps.io/submittedVersion-final-project-dashboard/)

Created a dashboard to visualize Tempe accidents given different inputs of time, day, month, year, weather condition, direction, 
and more.
