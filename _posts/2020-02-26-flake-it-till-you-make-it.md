From the time I was a kid, I have been really interested in creating handmade items. My top favorite hobbies are DIY (do-it-yourself) home decor, origami, and crochet! Creating (and DIY'ing) have always been and always will be interests and passions of mine. Adding my own personality and unique twist to items that I craft gives me immense joy. For example, I have been learning crochet recently. After seeing many YouTube tutorials, I experimented combining various stitches using various colors of yarn to see what can be created out of them. I learn best by doing. When it comes to crocheting, that is exactly how one can learn the art. 

I also have a lot of non-artistic interests. I work out few times a week. I enjoy listening to pop music and Korean Pop Music (also known as K-pop). I enjoy watching TV, talking to friends, and singing. I am also a lover of boba, puns, and memes!
